# Android Hello World

Just an extended Hello World example pure Android app that:

- [ ] Released on Play Store
- [ ] Has unit test
- [ ] Has integration test
- [ ] Auto test on CI
- [ ] Auto publish to Play Store

I make this to learn about Android release process and apply some best practice
in Softwaren Engineering to this field. If you are a seasoned Android developer,
there's nothing here for you. This may be helpful for someone who just finished
some tutorials and want to learn the next steps.

App is generated using Android Studio, with slightly modification, nothing
interesting. The following content mainly about how to relase and setup CI/CD
for the app. Of course, it's unlikely that you will understand the **why**
behind all following commands, configs. This can help you get your hand dirty,
but nothing can replace proper study. So, after having fun, please take your
time read the linked documents.
